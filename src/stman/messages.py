Type  "help" in the console at any time for guidance.

Notes:
I highly recommend you run this terminal program as an admin; it
will help prevent permission errors.

If a folder's size is listed as "CNC," it means that it couldn't be
calculated. You can hide these with the "togglecnc" command.

Most core system folders are inaccessible even with admin permissions.
In addition to this, they tend to contain ridiculous amounts of subfolders and 
lead to large calculation times, so I advise against using the program on them.

Use "togglewelcome" to hide this message.'''
