Type  "help" in the console at any time for guidance.

Notes:
- Running this program as an admin is recommended for folder permission reasons.
- A folder size of "X" means that it's inaccessible.
- A folder size in green means that its size could only be partially calculated.
- Avoid using this tool on system folders or files, they tend to be both inaccessible
and very large, leading to long calculation times.

Use "togglewelcome" to hide this message.'''
